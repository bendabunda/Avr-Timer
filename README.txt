Two years ago i modified a scanner replacing its mechanism and all the internal electronics with UV lamps converting it to an UV exposure box for PCB prototyping. By the need to make it better and my life easier i designed an AVR timer to automatic switch off the lamps after 1 minute of exposure which was much enough for the PCBs.
